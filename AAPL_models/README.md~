Note this is only predicting one time step out, and then using the true data again for next prediction. Not true autoregressive model. 

Accuracy Ranking:
1. Biderectional LSTM
2. LSTM
   
For speed, use batching (leads to lesser accuracy, however):
1. batching_lstm.ipynb
2. or create own batching on biderectional lstm.
